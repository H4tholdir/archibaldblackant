<objective>
Remove dead code and backup files from the codebase.

Purpose: Clean up unused code for better maintainability and reduced confusion.
Output: No backup files, no unused code in product-sync-service, clean codebase.

**From CONCERNS.md:**
- Dead code exists in product-sync-service.ts
- Backup files present (*.backup-* files)

**Current state:**
- Logging and typing cleanup complete
- Ready for dead code removal

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Identify and remove dead code in product-sync-service.ts</name>
  <files>src/product-sync-service.ts</files>
  <action>
Review product-sync-service.ts for dead code:
- Commented-out code blocks that are no longer needed
- Unused functions or methods
- Unreachable code paths
- Debug code that should be removed

Remove dead code patterns:
- Large commented-out sections (/* ... */ or multiple //)
- Functions defined but never called (check with grep if uncertain)
- Imports not used
- Console.log already removed, but check for commented debug lines

CAREFUL: Only remove code that is clearly unused. If uncertain:
- Check if function is exported and used in other files
- Check git history to understand why it was commented
- Keep code if there's any doubt about usage

DO NOT remove legitimate business logic or error handling.
  </action>
  <verify>Review diff to confirm only dead code removed, no active logic affected</verify>
  <done>Dead code removed from product-sync-service.ts, file is cleaner</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove all backup files</name>
  <files>src/*.backup*</files>
  <action>
Remove all backup files from src/ directory:
1. List all backup files: `find src/ -name "*.backup*" -type f`
2. Review list to confirm they are backups (timestamp pattern, .backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
3. Remove them: `find src/ -name "*.backup*" -type f -delete`

These backup files were created during development and are no longer needed:
- Git history preserves old versions
- They clutter the codebase
- May cause confusion (which version is current?)

If backup files contain useful code not in current version:
- Extract that code first, then delete backup
- Document in summary what was preserved

Otherwise, delete all backup files.
  </action>
  <verify>find src/ -name "*.backup*" returns empty</verify>
  <done>All backup files removed, git history preserves old versions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify build and no regressions</name>
  <files>N/A</files>
  <action>
Verification after cleanup:
1. TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` (must pass)
2. Check no files reference deleted code: `grep -r "deletedFunctionName" src/` if you removed functions
3. Run Vitest tests: `npm test` (should still pass)
4. Review git diff: `git diff` to see all changes

If any issues found:
- TypeScript errors → restore necessary code
- Failed tests → investigate and fix
- Imports broken → check references

Document in summary:
- How many backup files removed
- What dead code was removed from product-sync-service
- Any useful code preserved from backups
  </action>
  <verify>TypeScript compiles, tests pass, git diff shows only cleanup changes</verify>
  <done>Codebase clean, no regressions, builds successfully</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Dead code removed from product-sync-service.ts
- [ ] All backup files deleted
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Tests still pass
- [ ] No regressions introduced
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 3 tasks completed
- No backup files remain
- Dead code removed
- Codebase cleaner and more maintainable
- No functionality lost

# Phase 2 Plan 06: Remove Dead Code

**Codebase cleaned - [X] backup files and dead code removed**

## Accomplishments

- Removed dead code from product-sync-service.ts
- Deleted all backup files (*.backup*)
- Codebase is cleaner and more maintainable
- TypeScript compilation verified
- No regressions introduced

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/product-sync-service.ts` - Dead code removed
- Deleted: [list of backup files removed]

## Decisions Made

[Document what dead code was removed and why, any code preserved from backups]

## Issues Encountered

[Document any problems and resolutions, or "None"]

## Next Step

Ready for 02-07-PLAN.md (Unit Tests for Database Layer)
