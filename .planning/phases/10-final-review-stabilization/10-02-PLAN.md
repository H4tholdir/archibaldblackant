<objective>
Create production readiness documentation and complete the Archibald Stabilization milestone.

Purpose: Document the final state of the PWA after 10 phases of stabilization work, providing a clear picture of what was accomplished, what's working, and any remaining known limitations.
Output: Production readiness document, updated STATE.md (100%), updated ROADMAP.md (all complete), milestone summary.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create production readiness document</name>
  <files>.planning/PRODUCTION-STATE.md</files>
  <action>
Create a comprehensive production readiness document summarizing the state of the PWA after the stabilization milestone. Structure:

## Production State: Archibald Black Ant PWA

### Overview
- Brief description of what was accomplished across all 10 phases
- Current deployment status (VPS, domain, SSL)

### Architecture
- Frontend: React PWA (Vite + TypeScript)
- Backend: Express + Puppeteer + BullMQ + PostgreSQL + Redis
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose on Hetzner VPS
- Real-time: WebSocket server for multi-device sync

### Test Coverage
- Backend unit tests: count and what they cover
- Frontend unit tests: count and what they cover
- E2E tests: 35 tests, what flows they cover
- Integration tests: what they cover

### Services & Endpoints
- List all API endpoint groups (/api/auth, /api/customers, etc.)
- WebSocket endpoint (/ws/)
- Health check (/api/health)

### Infrastructure Config
- Rate limiting: backend (500 req/60s global), Nginx (30r/s api, 5r/m login)
- SSL: Let's Encrypt auto-renewal
- Docker services: list all containers
- Automated cleanup: daily Docker cleanup, disk monitoring

### Known Limitations
- ~50 unused type exports (cosmetic, deferred)
- Frontend fetchWithRetry doesn't handle 429 (mitigated by auth-guard in E2E)
- Any other limitations from 10-01 verification

### Monitoring
- Health endpoint: /api/health
- Prometheus: port 9090
- Grafana: port 3001
- Docker logs

Populate all sections with real data by reading summaries, checking current codebase state, and referencing 10-01 verification results. Count actual test files and tests. List actual API endpoints from server.ts routes.

  <name>Task 2: Complete project milestone — update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Update project state to reflect milestone completion:

1. **STATE.md updates:**
   - Progress: 100%
   - Status: Milestone 1 complete
   - Current focus: "Archibald Stabilization milestone complete"
   - Last activity: today's date
   - Session continuity: "Milestone complete. No pending work."

2. **ROADMAP.md updates:**
   - Mark Phase 10 checkbox as [x]
   - Mark both plans (10-01, 10-02) as [x]
   - Update progress table: Phase 10 row with "Complete" and today's date
   - Mark all other unchecked phase checkboxes as [x] (Phase 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 still show [ ] in phases list even though they're complete in the progress table — fix this inconsistency)

3. **Verify consistency:**
   - All 10 phases marked [x] in phases list
   - All plans marked [x] in phase details
   - Progress table shows 10/10 phases complete
  </action>
  <verify>
- STATE.md shows 100% progress
- ROADMAP.md shows all 10 phases [x] in phases list
- ROADMAP.md progress table shows all phases "Complete"
- No inconsistencies between phases list and progress table
  </verify>
  <done>Project state at 100%, all phases and plans marked complete, no inconsistencies</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] PRODUCTION-STATE.md exists with real data (not placeholders)
- [ ] STATE.md shows 100% progress, milestone complete
- [ ] ROADMAP.md shows all 10 phases [x]
- [ ] ROADMAP.md progress table fully updated
- [ ] No checkbox inconsistencies in ROADMAP.md
- [ ] All files committed
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Production readiness document created with comprehensive real data
- Project state at 100%
- All phases and plans marked complete in roadmap
- Phase 10 complete
- Archibald Stabilization milestone complete
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-final-review-stabilization/10-02-SUMMARY.md`

This is the LAST plan of Phase 10 AND the LAST phase of the milestone.
Success criteria includes "Archibald Stabilization milestone complete."
